    Args:
        blocks (list<str>): a list of string values that determine which blocks you should move 
                            and in which order. For example, if blocks = ["red", "green", "blue"] 
                            that means that you need to first move red block. 
                            Your function should at minimum work for the following values of blocks:

        img (PIL.Image): a PIL image containing the current arrangement of robot and blocks.
